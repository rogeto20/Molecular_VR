Folders
=======
Scripts:
Scripts is the bulk of the code and where most of the functionality for the application is.
All scripts have a header that gives a brief overview of what they do.

Editor:
Editor is used in debugging and building the application. This is utilities that help us develop the 
application more quickly and efficiently. This code will not be present in the final build. 

SteamVR and TextMeshPro:
This contains code that we didnt write; it is a Unity package so do not look at this.
